# BrainTrust Bot: Rails

A re-write of the original [BrainTrust Bot](https://github.com/terabyte128/braintrust-bot), but with Ruby on Rails and better planning. 
The original bot has served its purpose well for multiple years, but it's time to start on something built from the ground-up. 

The original bot has been subject to "feature creep" and, given the lack of foresight when it was originally written, did not handle this well. 
A lot of its features were "hacked on" because we originally did not anticipate their existence. So this is an attempt to start over, with a 
better understanding of which features were actually useful and how to implement them in a reasonable way.


In (semi-)active development, when I have time to work on it. Coming soon (â„¢) to a chat near you!
